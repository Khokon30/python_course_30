        <h1> Necessity of Learning English </h1>
        <P>
            <b><i>English is an international language</i></b>. It is a generally accepted language for maintaining effective communication with the rest of the world.<br>
            <u>So English is necessary for all sorts of internatinal commmunication like trade and commerce</u>.<br>
            Most of the books of higher studies are written in English. As a result, higher education is almost impossible without good knowledge of English.<br>
            English is most helpful to a man during his stay in a foreign country. English is the main or official language of most of the international and many regional organisations.<br>
            English is important to work with them. Most of the great works of literature of the world are either written or translated in English.<br>
            Only English can help us to know about them. English is unavoidable in medical science, information and tehnology.<br>
            Again, proficiency in English is often considered the standard of qualification. English can help us to get good jobs and better salaries.<br>
           <strong><i><u> In fact, English is helpful to us in many ways and we must learn English.</u></i></strong>
